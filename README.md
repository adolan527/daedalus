A WIP program that will allow for very basic CAD assemblies that are used to calculate the torque required to move an assembly.

Documentation folder has (somewhat deprecated) diagrams.

A working executable can be found [here](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/blob/main/cmake-build-debug/torqueCalculator.exe)
The program does create one directory and two files in whatever directory you put it in.

### What is currently working
 - Basic GUI
 - File and project management system
 - Configuration and settings
 - Data structures and architecture
 - Some of the math
### What needs to get done
 - 3D rendering of assemblies/projects
 - The rest of the math
 - More GUI
 - Better UI
