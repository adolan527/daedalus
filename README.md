A WIP program that will allow for very basic CAD assemblies that are used to calculate the torque required to move an assembly.

Documentation folder has diagrams.

Roadmap :
1. Data structure reorganization - The current diagram is not concurrent with the old code, the old code is jank, and the current diagram seems convoluted.
2. Implement more object types (shapes).
3. Functions for managing objects
       Create
       Delete
       Edit
       Save (probably will be done along with closeProject)

4. Defaults and configuration options
5. Calculation and CLI display
6. GUI
7. Documentation
8. QOL
