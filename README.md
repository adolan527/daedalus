A program that will allow for very basic CAD assemblies and the calculation of how much torque is required to rotate said assemblies around an axis.
Intended to be useful for robotics design, such as in FRC.

The documentation folder has (somewhat deprecated) diagrams.

A working executable can be found [here](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/blob/main/cmake-build-debug/torqueCalculator.exe)
The program does create one directory and two files in whatever directory you put it in.


## Guide to Running
1. Download the .exe [here:](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/blob/main/cmake-build-debug/torqueCalculator.exe)
2. Create a directory/folder and put the .exe into said directory.
3. Run the program

The .exe will create all of the necessary subdirectories and files when it initializes itself.

# File Structure

## Projects
Contains a folder for each project, in addition to a **projects.dat** file.
projects.dat is a list of all of the projects, as generated by the Windows command "dir /b/a:d > projects.dat". 

### Project folder
Folder with the same name as the project. Contains **info.dat** and **objects.dat**. info.dat contains the following information in the following format:
Name: NAME
Notes: NOTES
objects.dat contains the binary data for all of the objects in that project. This should not edited.

## Resources
The resources folder that the program generates contains many of the assets that the program uses. Although not necessary they make it look much nicer.

### Fonts
In the fonts folder, a **main** and **title** file can be placed to affect the fonts in those locations. On this repository, you can find the ones I used.
Both **.ttf** and **.otf** are accepted.

### Shaders
The program only expects a light shader that is defined by the **lighting.vs** and **lighting.fs** files contained in this repository. Anything not following these names
will be ignored, and using shader files other than the ones contained in this repository will is undefined behavior.
Note: These shaders were copied from the [Raylib basic lighting example](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/examples/shaders/shaders_basic_lighting.c).

### Textures
The textures folder contains **.png** files matching the names of the materials in the program, and uses these images as textures.
If you have a material named "Steel", you should have a file name **Steel.png** in the textures folder (or else it will use the default texture).

### Colors and Materials
These two **.dat** files are stored in a binary format. colors.dat contains all of the palettes stored contiguously (each palette is 10 colors, and each color is 4 bytes RGBA).
