A WIP program that will allow for very basic CAD assemblies and the calculation of how much torque is required to rotate said assemblies around an axis.
Intended to be useful for robotics design, such as in FRC.

The documentation folder has (somewhat deprecated) diagrams.

A working executable can be found [here](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/blob/main/cmake-build-debug/torqueCalculator.exe)
The program does create one directory and two files in whatever directory you put it in.

### What is currently working
 - Basic GUI
 - File and project management system
 - Configuration and settings
 - Data structures and architecture
 - Some of the math
### What needs to get done
 - 3D rendering of assemblies/projects
 - The rest of the math
 - More GUI
 - Better UI


## Guide to Running
1. Download the .exe [here:](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/blob/main/cmake-build-debug/torqueCalculator.exe)
2. Create a directory/folder and put the .exe into said directory.
3. Run the program

A couple of files will be created, some of which will be empty. Namely the information regarding colors, materials, and textures. This will be included later as the project develops.
Currently, (1/16/2024) there is no way to run the 3D assembly part of the program unless you manually create project files. That will be implemented before February.
