A WIP program that will allow for very basic CAD assemblies and the calculation of how much torque is required to rotate said assemblies around an axis.
Intended to be useful for robotics design, such as in FRC.

The documentation folder has (somewhat deprecated) diagrams.

A working executable can be found [here](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/blob/main/cmake-build-debug/torqueCalculator.exe)
The program does create one directory and two files in whatever directory you put it in.

### What is currently working
 - Basic GUI
 - File and project management system
 - Configuration and settings
 - Data structures and architecture
 - Some of the math
 - 3D rendering of objects
### What needs to get done
 - Ability to create projects and objects
 - The rest of the math
 - More GUI
 - Better UI


## Guide to Running
1. Download the .exe [here:](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/blob/main/cmake-build-debug/torqueCalculator.exe)
2. Create a directory/folder and put the .exe into said directory.
3. Run the program
4. Download [this](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/tree/main/cmake-build-debug/projects) file into the projects folder.
5. Download everything inside of the [resources](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/tree/main/cmake-build-debug/resources) folder into your resources folder.
6. Replace the generated colors.dat and materials.dat with two files found inside of [here:](https://github.com/adolan527/torqueCalculator/blob/main/cmake-build-debug)

This process is more complicated right now because a lot of the glue that would be holding parts of the program together has yet to be implemented.
